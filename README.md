The purpose of this program is to chat with a chatbot (human/computer interaction), where we use indexOf to find strings and we learn  about handling responses with words and phrases. 

We needed to understand various string methods and how they are utilized in order to work through this program.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand the different string methods and needed to understand how they could be used in this program. 
I even was able to work through my worksheet this way. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed chatting with Magpie and the various and Chatbot, Alice. It is quite fascinating how humans are able to talk to computers 
and how it takes coding to do so.
